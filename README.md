# Adventofcode2020

Contains my code base for Advent of Code 2020.

Lots of python flailing trying to race the shack leaderboard.

Thoughts on Problems

1.) Data Input and searching text.  Straight forward.

2.) REGEX.

3.) More data input parsing.  I should've used modulo instead of just subtracting and offsetting

4.) Part 1 was easy.  Part 2 was a nightmare of regex and data validation

5.) First one that didn't come easily to me.  I built the matrix of seats.  I need to go back and do this
    problem with bitshifting

6.) Another problem where python's data structure makes it trivial.

7.) Recursion and graph building.  Depth first search here.  Had to recall a bunch of college courses and a
    bunch of googling.

8.) STATE MACHINE.  I enjoy these problems, they're pretty fun and extending the state machine is great.

9.) Using from ittertools import accumulator, made it straight forward for part b.  Just a bunch of list slicing
    for part a.
